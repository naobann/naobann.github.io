      <p class = "pagetext">This study attempts to build a predicting and decision
        typology model based on statistical(regression, cluster analysis)
        analysis of historic TOD data to provide clear guidelines for site
        selection and choice of development strategy given specific goals for
        decision-makers in public transit agency. The dataset is 145 station-areas
        with TOD interventions between 1995 and 2005 in 15 states. Click to see each station.</p>

     <p class="pagetext">Promoting economic development and increasing transit
       ridership are the two most frequently identified goals by transit agencies
       (Cervero 2004). Two performance indexes, Economic Development Index (EDI)
       and Travel Pattern Change Index (TPCI) are used to evaluate the success
       of TOD under goals of economic development and increase transit Ridership
       respectively, both of which are historic percent change index from 2005
       to 2015. EDI consists of Unemployment rate decrease, Percent property
       value increase, Vacancy rate decrease, Median household income increase,
       and Percent population density increase. Select your TOD goal, click "See Stations' TOD Performance Index",
       and click each station to see its performance index under your selected goal.</p>

    <p class="pagetext">Clusters are cluster analysis results under certain goal's
       pre-condition predicting performance index significant variables. Clusters
       A, B, C are from the same cluster analysis under the goal of economic development,
       and Clusters D, E, F are from the other cluster analysis model under the
       goal of transit ridership increase.

       cluster analysis results of significant performance predictors of
       predevelopment conditions, so the variables to cluster stations into different
       clusters are not the same, which means each station belongs to two clusters,

    <p class="pagetext">If the goal is to promote economic development, select a
      site in pre-condition Type B (poor, historic, walkable) would have a higher
      probability of good achievements; if the goal is to increase transit
      ridership and change travel pattern, select a site in pre-condition Type D
      (rich, median density) would have a higher probability of good achievements
      Given site and goal, the development strategies of high achievers in the
      siteâ€™s same pre-condition cluster might suggest a replicable development strategy.
